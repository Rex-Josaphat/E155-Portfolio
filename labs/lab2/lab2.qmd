## Introduction

## Experiment Setup

### Time-multiplexing Logic
The human eye can detect flickering up to $\sim60 Hz (around 16.67 ms per cycle)$. With two digits, each must be active at least 120 switches per second (60Hz * 2). This means my logic had to switch every $\sim8.3 ms$ or less.
I opted to switch at every $2 ms$ which gives a $250 Hz$ refresh rate, too fast for the human eye to detect.
